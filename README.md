# OCR-convertion
Pytesseract is a Python package that allows you to extract text from images. If you have a picture that has some text in it, pytesseract can pull out the text into a Python program. That's pretty cool. Pytesseract is a wrapper around a program from Google called tesseract. It's tesseract that extracts the text from pictures. Pytesseract is there to help you use tesseract in your Python programs.

This code uses Pytesseract as an example of an OCR application, which stands for Optical Character Recognition.
Which is just a fancy way of saying using a computer to read text. Tesseract is capable of reading text in many different languages.

It works best with computer-generated text like text in PDFs or pictures of receipts and invoices. It has a tougher time with images that contain handwritten words.
On more info about Pytesseract and it's installation visit:  https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-to-install-pytesseract.html#:~:text=Point%20pytesseract%20at%20your%20tesseract%20installation%20Create%20a,of%20the%20string%20that%20defines%20the%20file%20location.

During Installation you will be prompted on which language you wanna install, for this project i installed English.


# LOOP HOLES
Pytesseract performs poorly when it encounters handwritten images, images in .PNG format are best used.

Note: The code is in ipynb(notebook) format.
